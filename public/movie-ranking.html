<h1>Movie Fan Fun List!</h1>
<h2>Erynn's Top Tier Movies at a Glance</h2>

<h3>Sin City (2005)</h3>
<p>Film noire is a fascinating art form. Everything from its dark, gritty take on the world we live in to its
    imaginative and often exaggerated characters all the way to its brutally descriptive and thoughtful narrative
    style that's unfailingly woven with all manners of thought  provoking metaphors. I can think of no better
    example of a modernized revival of this dead art form than the movie Sin City, based off of Frank Millers'
    graphic novel series of the same title. The movie encompasses 3 short stories, each told from the viewpoint
    of their respective main character and of course taking place within the titular city, in a sort of "alternate
    reality" that blends American 1950's fashion and visual style with modern technology such as cell phones and
    modernized weaponry. It's a very gritty and brutal movie. Not for the faint of heart indeed, but if you can 
    stomach a few buckets of blood and a few very disturbing characters, it is an undisputed masterpiece.

<h3>The Fifth Element (1997)</h3>
<p>A science fiction gem from the late 90s, The Fifth Element brilliantly blends elements of comedy, drama and
    romance into an exciting, stylish and delightfully nostalgic experience. The film is visually fascinating
and just absolutely dripping with incredibly well thought out scenery and set designs. The story is a little
bit cliche at times, but I feel that its forgivable considering everything that the movie itself has to offer.
Imagine if during a star wars movie, that the actors kept on firing off funny one liners and then winking at
the camera. That is pretty much in essence what's going on here. The casting for this movie is off the hook as
well, featuring such names as Mila Jovovich, Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman among its' cast and including several
other big names from the time. I highly recommend this fun action packed scifi thrill ride that also isn't afraid
to laugh at itself along the way and I hope that you enjoy it and have a few laughs as well!

<h3>The Crow (1994)</h3>
<p>Another movie from the 90s, but this time with a more "noire" vibes. The Crow is an emotionally charged tale
    of revenge centered largely around the ways in which the corrupted world we live in tears families apart and 
    destroys peoples lives. Much like my other recommendations here, this film also benefits from a stunning and 
    unique visual style that really drives home the feel of its dark, seedy world. Make sure you have a box of
    tissues handy as well because this one is definitely gonna make you tear up more than a few times. The film 
    itself is dedicated to Brandon Lee, who was unfortunately killed mid-performance in a filming accident. He was 
    an amazing actor and a goodhearted person and will be sorely missed forever and always, but his greatest and 
    most heartfelt work went into this film and I highly recommend you check it out, as it was an absolutely 
    incredible legacy to have left behind.
